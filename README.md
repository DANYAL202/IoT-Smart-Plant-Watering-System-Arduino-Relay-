# IoT-Smart-Plant-Watering-System-Arduino-Relay-
This IoT project uses an Arduino and a soil moisture sensor to water a plant automatically via a relay. When the soil is dry, the relay activates a water pump to irrigate the plant.  Hardware:      Arduino Uno     Soil Moisture Sensor     Relay Module     Water Pump
